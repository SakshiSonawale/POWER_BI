## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of crimes against women in India. The objective is to highlight trends, patterns, and critical insights that can help stakeholders understand the seriousness of the issue and support data-driven decision-making for prevention and policy-making.

The dashboard goes beyond simple visualizations by uncovering hidden insights, identifying high-risk states/regions, and analyzing factors influencing crime rates.

- To identify regions/states with the highest reported cases.

- To compare crime categories (e.g., domestic violence, harassment, assault, dowry cases).

- To understand socio-economic and demographic factors influencing crime rates.

- To provide actionable insights for awareness and prevention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
